NOTE: The following files:

  povcmax32.dll
  povcmax32-sse2.dll
  povcmax64.dll

are NOT covered by the AGPL3 license that applies to POV-Ray v3.7.

These DLL's implement the codemax code editor that may be optionally
used within POV-Ray for Windows.

If present at all, they are provided pursuant to the license that
applied to the previous version of POV-Ray (v3.62) and may only be
used or distributed under those terms.

See http://www.povray.org/povlegal.html for more information.

The files cmedit32.dll, cmedit32-sse2.dll and cmedit64.dll are part
of the editor interface code (they provide the layer that connects
POVWIN to the codemax editor) but contain no codemax code and thus
are licensed under the AGPL3.
